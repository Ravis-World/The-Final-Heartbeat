📢 Notes
--------

This is part of the ongoing **Heartbeat Project** within the _Raviolo The Magician_ series. For the best experience, it’s recommended to [play the earlier stories first](https://sites.google.com/view/1000-heartbeats/prologue) — but _The Final Heartbeat_ can also be enjoyed as a standalone.
